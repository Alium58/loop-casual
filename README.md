# Overview

This is a Grey You softcore script, based on the [loop-casual](https://github.com/Kasekopf/loop-casual) framework. It does not currently work.

### Strategy

The script is designed to be run as part of a loop. In particular, it expects that something like [garbo](https://github.com/Loathing-Associates-Scripting-Society/garbage-collector) will use the rest of the turns. This means that profitable daily resources (e.g. copiers) are avoided, but other resources (free runaways, kills, some wanderers) are used to save turns where possible.
